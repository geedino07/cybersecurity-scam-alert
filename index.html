    <h1>Tech Support Scam Awareness</h1>

    <p>Tech support scams trick people into believing their computer or account is infected or compromised. They often begin with alarming pop-ups, calls, or texts pretending to be from trusted companies like Microsoft or Apple. The goal is to create panic and urgency.</p>

    <h2>How the Scam Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A fake alert claims your system is infected or at risk.</li>
      <li>A “technician” convinces you to call a number or click a link.</li>
      <li>You’re asked to install remote access software.</li>
      <li>Fake problems appear, followed by a demand for payment.</li>
      <li>Scammers steal money, personal information, or gain long-term access to your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What Scammers Want</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Money:</strong> Fees paid via cards, gift cards, wire transfers, or crypto</li>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Banking details, passwords, identity data</li>
      <li><strong>Device Access:</strong> To spy, steal files, or install real malware</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay calm, legitimate companies don’t use pop-ups or unsolicited calls.</li>
      <li>Never call numbers shown in pop-ups.</li>
      <li>Don’t give remote access to unknown people.</li>
      <li>If exposed, change passwords and monitor financial accounts immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why It’s Increasing</h2>
    <p>With Windows 11 updates and the end of Windows 10 support (October 2025), scammers exploit confusion around system upgrades and security warnings.</p>

    <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Tech support scams rely on fear and trust. Legitimate companies will never demand payment or remote access unexpectedly. Skepticism and caution are your best defenses.</p>
